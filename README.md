# Bar Chart Race - Unemployment in Cyprus

This repository contains the relevant files required for building a bar chart race visulisation using Flourish.

For demostration purposes I used a dataset about unemployment in Cyprus but the same process can be applied to any other dataset.

Here is the relevant blog post for building the visualisation:

## Visualisation

Additionally, this repository contains the saved visualisation that was created for the unemployment dataset as an html file. 

To view it, simply open up the  `visualisation.html` file in the `visualisation_html` folder.
